# RFC 4648 (Base 64, 32, 16 encoding) Implementation

## Modern interface
The code uses C++ 20 features, I build the library & tests with GCC 10.2 and Clang 11.0.


## Header only
The code itself is only one header - `include/bases/bases.hpp`, so you can copy paste it into your project. 

## License
The code is licensed under the [Boost Software License 1.0](https://www.boost.org/users/license.html). Which is a very permissive [OSI-Approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSL-1.0) open source license used by the Boost project. I have included the license text in `bases.hpp`, so just copypasting it, without any additional LICENSE files etc. is sufficient. 

## Testing
This library relies on unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
For each encoding there are 3 test cases: `BaseX Test Vectors` as described in the RFC, `BaseX encoding` - The test cases are autogenerated using a python script `tests/gen.py` and `Base64 Edge Cases` - which are manually written cases which, as the name suggests, tests for edge cases and correct errors.
### Building tests
The `CMakeLists.txt` file is used to build the tests. `python gen.py` would generate the fuzz tests, but sample ones generated by me are already included. The building steps are the usual:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 8
```
